## Context

The name `octadocs-decisions` is very broad. There are multiple ways to make a decision; this package is actually about one specific method of making decisions - about writing ADR documents. 

## Decision

We are renaming this to `octadocs-adr` for the sake of specificity.

## Consequences

The application hostname will be shorter: [https://adr.octadocs.io](https://adr.octadocs.io) ðŸ™‚
